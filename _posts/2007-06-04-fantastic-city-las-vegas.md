Have you ever been to Las Vegas? I had been 5 days in Las Vegas. In brief, I want to go to Las Vegas again if I had a lot of time.

Las Vegas is a beautiful city but only for the night. There're many hotels in Las Vegas. Each hotel had their own themes. When I arrived at the Bellagio hotel, I saw a splended water show in front of the hotel. That was AWESOME! Agter a few minutes, I had to find another place which made me crazy. Finally I found something in the Wynn hotel. It was a galbling machine. I lost my money in first time. I had put $20 into my machine. After only 1 game, I got $60 from my machine. Eventually, I won! It was a great time for me.
