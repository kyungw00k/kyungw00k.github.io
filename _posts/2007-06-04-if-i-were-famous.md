What do you want to be? Have you ever dreamed before? Everybody want to be a star. I've been dreaming when I became a famous computer architect. But I know that I need more practice now. By the way, what are you going to do if you become famous?

If I had been known as a famous individual globally, I would have been known for a computer architect. Because computer architect leads a computer industry and develops a new technology. If I became a computer architect, I would share my knowledge with others as good as possible. Also I would be teaching students whose majored in computer science.

However, in reality, I'm not famous. But someday, I believe I can be a famous computer architect! Now, I'm trying to solve a problem related to computer programming.

In short, I want to be a computer architect, and I'll study hard to achieve my dream.
