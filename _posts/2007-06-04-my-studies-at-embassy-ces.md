What have you learned since you came here?

I've seen many foreign students here. And the campus is so beautiful!! Also people are very kind to me. :) Moreover, I'm happy because I've a chance to know and to learn about cultural differences.

I was very nervous when I came here first. Everything was different from my country. And I felt that everything was not suit me. But now, I've become accustomed to living int this country. Sometimes, I dream that I'll go back to my country. But I'm still here for studying English. Absolutely I'll be studying English tomorrow. I'm hoping that I can speak English very well.

In brief, I need to study English for improving my English skills.
