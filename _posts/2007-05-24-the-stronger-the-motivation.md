**The stronger the motivation, the more quickly a student will learn English!**

In my case, the motivation is

- high-handed class atmosphere <- is it right expression?
- someone who excels in everything then me ( a.k.a 엄마친구아들 )
- someone who has a high TOEFL/TOEIC score then me.
- the other things which are better than me...

>Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
Don't be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice.

Beautiful Speech! don't you think?

Sometimes, I'm suffer from an inferiority complex.

I knew my own inner voice exactly, the right things.

I think, everyone has their own inner voice and is very well known about meaning of it.

Today, I made up my mind to practice!!
